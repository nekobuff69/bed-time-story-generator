**Wonder & Mac:** Infuse ordinary elements with a sense of magic through clever lighting, scale, and charming details.
**Compositi:** Simple, uncluttered, with a single dominant focal point and good use of negative space.
**Texture** Visually soft and inviting (e.g., fuzzy fur, smooth wood, fluffy clouds).

### 2. Art Style Choices (Choose ONE):
**Watercolor / Soft Painterly:** For dreamy, atmospheric scenes.
**Soft Pencil / Crayon Texture:** For a hand-drawn, approachable feel.
**Simplified, Stylized with Soft Edges:** For friendly, easy-to-understand shapes.
**Subtle Mixed Media:** For gentle tactile interest and warmth.

## Prompt Guidelines:
Begin with artistic reference, build subject and context around it. The prompt should include these elements in order: artistic style, subject, context, technical execution, mood reinforcement.
Example: “Art Nouveau flowing organic forms and elegant typography, depicting a graceful dancer in flowing silk dress, surrounded by stylized floral motifs, hand-drawn illustration with gold leaf accents, romantic and ethereal atmosphere”
